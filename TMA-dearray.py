"""
This script extracts individual cores from a Tissue Microarray (TMA) and saves them as PNG images.

It takes a text file with positions as input. This file can be generated using Qupath.

Procedure:
1. Load TMA in Qupath.
2. Select TMA --> TMA De-arrayer --> Run (set rows and columns appropriately).
3. Measure --> Show TMA Measurements --> Save txt file.

Additional Notes:

Before running the script, ensure OpenSlide is installed by executing the following commands:
1. Install openslide-python:
    ```
    pip install openslide-python
    ```
2. Download the latest Windows binaries from https://openslide.org/download/.
3. Extract the contents to a location for easy reference, preferably in the openslide directory in site-packages
On our system: "C:/Users/Admin/Anaconda3/envs/Py39_base/Lib/site-packages/openslide/openslide-win64-20231011/bin"

In case you are unsure of your site packages directory, use the following script to find the location:

import sys
for p in sys.path:
    print(p)
